&lt;p&gt;Maternal mortality is a significant public health problem in Nigeria. Despite a stated National Health Policy which articulates strategies to reduce maternal mortality, it is still a big problem with Nigeria contributing 19% of global pregnancy-related deaths. The high maternal mortality rate arises from a complex and dynamic interaction of several individual-related and community-related factors which are worsened by the lack of an organizing framework. This paper presents the path-goal theory of leadership as a leadership theory for organizing maternal health services in Nigeria. The path-goal theory is a conceptual leadership model which is pragmatic and adaptable at the different levels of government and in different situations. The path-goal theory also is suitable for using the systems thinking approach to implementing programs designed to reduce maternal mortality in Nigeria in an integrated way. Evaluation of the path-goal theory can be done at the state and community level to assess which path-goal leadership styles predict the use of antenatal care.

&lt;h2 id=&quot;introduction&quot;&gt;Introduction&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The World Health Organization (2018) defines maternal mortality as “the death of a woman during pregnancy or within 42 days of delivery or termination of the pregnancy, regardless of the duration and location of the pregnancy, from any cause related to or exacerbated by the pregnancy or its management”. Maternal mortality is a proxy measure of the quality of a country’s health care system. It is also an indicator of economic and gender equality and health equity (Afulukwe-Eruchalu, 2017). One of the key objectives of the National Health Policy and Strategy to Achieve Health for all Nigerians is the reduction of maternal mortality. The National Health Policy outlines strategies to achieve this reduction. These strategies include improving equitable access to reproductive health services and ensuring that resources required to provide such services are available (Federal Ministry of Health, 2016).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;literature-review&quot;&gt;Literature Review&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Nigeria has one of the highest maternal mortality ratios (MMR) in the world. There were 814 [95% CI 596, 1180] deaths per 100,000 live births in 2016 in Nigeria which is approximately 58,000 maternal deaths annually in Nigeria. This figure is the highest number of maternal deaths of any country. About 19% of global maternal deaths occur in Nigeria (World Health Organization et al., 2015).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;risk-factors-for-maternal-mortality&quot;&gt;Risk Factors for Maternal Mortality&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Maternal mortality results from a complex interplay of various factors which include individual, sociocultural, economics, logistics, poor and scarce health services delivery, and community factors (Azuh et al., 2017; Dahiru &amp;amp; Oche, 2015). The women who are most at risk of dying during or shortly after childbirth are those with no formal education, who have a low income, who are living in the rural areas, adolescent, unmarried, and in the Northern part of Nigeria. For example, Doctor et al. (2012) found that in the Northern Nigeria rural state of Zamfara the lifetime risk of maternal death was 8% in the 10.5 years before their study. This is roughly a risk of 1 in 12 women dying during childbirth in Zamfara state. They also estimated a very high MMR of 1,049 deaths per 100,000 live births (Doctor et al., 2012). Babalola and Fatusi (2009) found that education, socio-economic level, urban residence, community media saturation are consistently strong predictors of antenatal care. Other less consistent predictors of antenatal care were the woman’s age at the birth of the last child, ethnicity, ideal family size, and acceptance of family planning, and the availability of primary healthcare (PHC) facilities (Babalola &amp;amp; Fatusi, 2009).
The use of antenatal care and family planning is associated with better maternal health outcomes. In Nigeria, not all pregnant women use maternal health services for various reasons, and some only use it partially (Fagbamigbe &amp;amp; Idemudia, 2015). Some women refuse to have necessary cesarean sections because of sociocultural connotations that are informed by gender and religious ideologies, the relational consequences of having a cesarean section, and the role of alternative providers (Ugwu &amp;amp; de Kok, 2015). Data from the 2005 National HIV/AIDS and Reproductive Health Survey showed that only 60.3% of mothers attended antenatal care at least once during their most recent pregnancy. Even less (43.5%) had a skilled birth attendant present at birth and only 41.2% received any postnatal care (Babalola &amp;amp; Fatusi, 2009). Also, the 2013 Nigeria Demographic Health Survey (NDHS) found that 61% of pregnant women had at least one ANC visit compared to 38% of women whose recent deliveries was undertaken by a skilled health worker (National Population Commission (NPC) [Nigeria] &amp;amp; ICF International, 2014). These data show not only the non-utilization of antenatal care but also the discordance between antenatal care attendance and delivery by a skilled health provider. Other factors like improved transportation, and access to mobile telephone technology also influence maternal health (Alkema et al., 2016).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;interventions-that-reduce-maternal-mortality&quot;&gt;Interventions that Reduce Maternal Mortality&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There are interventions which are useful in reducing maternal deaths. Ahmed, Li, Liu, &amp;amp; Tsui (2012) used a counterfactual model of data from 172 countries to show that contraceptive use could reduce maternal deaths by 44%. Fulfilling the unmet need for contraception would prevent 104,000 maternal deaths per year leading to a 29% reduction in maternal deaths (Ahmed et al., 2012). Increasing access to family planning is the single most effective intervention to reduce maternal mortality (Erim, Resch, &amp;amp; Goldie, 2012). The use of family planning prevents nearly 1 in 5 abortion-related deaths. Implementing strategies that integrate increased skilled deliveries, facility births, access to antenatal and postpartum care, improved recognition of referral need, transport, availability and quality of emergency obstetric care (EmOC) together with family planning and safe abortion would prevent 4 out of 5 maternal deaths (Erim et al., 2012). The available evidence shows that EmOC is effective in reducing pregnancy-related morbidity and mortality (Paxton, Maine, Freedman, Fry, &amp;amp; Lobis, 2005). Several states have implemented EmOC in Nigeria, but MMR figures are still high partly due to the high cost of EmOC, insufficient health infrastructure, non-availability of blood and blood products (Banke-Thomas et al., 2017). 
The most significant source of healthcare financing in Nigeria is out-of-pocket payments. Out-of-pocket payments contribute as much as 65.6 % of total health expenditure in Nigeria (Ebeigbe, 2013). This situation contrasts sharply with more effective health systems like in South Africa where health care is free for pregnant and breastfeeding mothers. As a consequence, South Africa reports less than a tenth of the total maternal deaths reported from Nigeria annually.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The current Nigeria health financing system is not equitable and increases the risk of maternal deaths since it does not provide access to health care for the most vulnerable segments of the population (Ebeigbe, 2013). 
Financial strategies designed to reduce the cost of accessing maternal health services are useful interventions that promote better maternal health outcomes. A range of financial strategies that includes removing user fees, providing health insurance and universal health coverage and free delivery care for pregnant women, use of conditional cash transfers, vouchers, and transport loans have been shown to reduce maternal mortality (Borghi, Ensor, Somanathan, Lissner, &amp;amp; Mills, 2006; Okoli et al., 2014). These financial schemes have varying degrees of effectiveness for improving maternal health outcomes (Borghi et al., 2006). Ononokpono, Odimegwu, Imasiku, and Adedini (2013) stated that improvements in antenatal care utilization might be strengthened by targeting poverty reduction programs and increasing health facility delivery in disadvantaged communities.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;leadership-gaps-in-systems-thinking-and-maternal-mortality&quot;&gt;Leadership Gaps in Systems Thinking and Maternal Mortality&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A systems thinking approach is needed to reduce maternal mortality. Effective leadership at the Federal, state, and local government levels is required to address the issue of maternal mortality. Leadership is needed to provide a strategic and integrated approach to reducing maternal mortality. As highlighted above, a complex and changing interplay of several factors and human relationships influence maternal mortality and also determine the effectiveness of various interventions designed to reduce maternal mortality. Leadership also plays an essential role in community mobilization. With the ethnic and cultural diversity of Nigeria, it is critical to account for ethnic and cultural differences in improving maternal health. Factors related to individuals cannot be separated from the factors related to the communities (Azuh et al., 2017; Babalola &amp;amp; Fatusi, 2009), therefore successful leadership models which improve maternal health will be directed at the community and can mobilize the community effectively to influence the public health status using systems thinking (Leischow &amp;amp; Milstein, 2006; Trochim, Cabrera, Milstein, Gallagher, &amp;amp; Leischow, 2006). Prata, Ejembi, Fraser, Shittu, and Minkler (2012) have also shown that active engagement of community leaders and traditional birth attendants contributes to more awareness of the risks of pregnancy and the benefits of using available maternal health services. 
There is little research on the role of effective leadership styles in reducing maternal mortality in Nigeria. A search of PubMed using the key search terms “Nigeria AND maternal mortality AND leadership” resulted in only six articles, none of which discussed leadership or a leadership model. A similar search of the CINAHL Plus database produced no article. There is a gap in research looking at useful leadership models or frameworks that account for sociocultural nuances in getting women and communities to accept interventions that reduce maternal mortality.&lt;/p&gt;</content><author><name>Adamu Onu</name></author><summary type="html">Abstract Maternal mortality is a significant public health problem in Nigeria.

&lt;h2 id=&quot;book-i&quot;&gt;Book I&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Sing, O goddess, the anger of Achilles son of Peleus, that brought countless ills upon the Achaeans. Many a brave soul did it send hurrying down to Hades, and many a hero did it yield a prey to dogs and vultures, for so were the counsels of Jove fulfilled from the day on which the son of Atreus, king of men, and great Achilles, first fell out with one another.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And which of the gods was it that set them on to quarrel? It was the son of Jove and Leto; for he was angry with the king and sent a pestilence upon the host to plague the people, because the son of Atreus had dishonoured Chryses his priest. Now Chryses had come to the ships of the Achaeans to free his daughter, and had brought with him a great ransom: moreover he bore in his hand the sceptre of Apollo wreathed with a suppliant’s wreath and he besought the Achaeans, but most of all the two sons of Atreus, who were their chiefs.
&lt;!--more--&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“Sons of Atreus,” he cried, “and all other Achaeans, may the gods who dwell in Olympus grant you to sack the city of Priam, and to reach your homes in safety; but free my daughter, and accept a ransom for her, in reverence to Apollo, son of Jove.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;On this the rest of the Achaeans with one voice were for respecting the priest and taking the ransom that he offered; but not so Agamemnon, who spoke fiercely to him and sent him roughly away. “Old man,” said he, “let me not find you tarrying about our ships, nor yet coming hereafter. Your sceptre of the god and your wreath shall profit you nothing. I will not free her. She shall grow old in my house at Argos far from her own home, busying herself with her loom and visiting my couch; so go, and do not provoke me or it shall be the worse for you.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The old man feared him and obeyed. Not a word he spoke, but went by the shore of the sounding sea and prayed apart to King Apollo whom lovely Leto had borne. “Hear me,” he cried, “O god of the silver bow, that protectest Chryse and holy Cilla and rulest Tenedos with thy might, hear me oh thou of Sminthe. If I have ever decked your temple with garlands, or burned your thigh-bones in fat of bulls or goats, grant my prayer, and let your arrows avenge these my tears upon the Danaans.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Thus did he pray, and Apollo heard his prayer. He came down furious from the summits of Olympus, with his bow and his quiver upon his shoulder, and the arrows rattled on his back with the rage that trembled within him. He sat himself down away from the ships with a face as dark as night, and his silver bow rang death as he shot his arrow in the midst of them. First he smote their mules and their hounds, but presently he aimed his shafts at the people themselves, and all day long the pyres of the dead were burning.&lt;/p&gt;</content><author><name></name></author><summary type="html">The Iliad Book I Sing, O goddess, the anger of Achilles son of Peleus, that brought countless ills upon the Achaeans.
