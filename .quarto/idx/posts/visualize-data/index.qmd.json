Data visualization may reveal relationships that may not otherwise be apparent. Also, important results can be communicated lucidly to your audience through graphs and charts. \n\nConsider this data set of 912 observations (@tbl-describe shows the first 10 rows of the data):\n\n\n::: {#tbl-describe .cell .tbl-cap-location-bottom tbl-cap='First few rows of data set'}\n encounter_date   number_of_patients   number_of_doctors   mean_wait_time \n---------------- -------------------- ------------------- ----------------\n   2020-01-01            120                  15               16.49      \n\n   2020-01-02            402                  50               59.59      \n\n   2020-01-03            363                  48                43.4      \n\n   2020-01-04            181                  15                29.6      \n\n   2020-01-05            130                  14               17.53      \n\n   2020-01-06            463                  54               64.54      \n\n   2020-01-07            474                  55               63.67      \n\n   2020-01-08            442                  49               58.72      \n\n   2020-01-09            509                  59               62.84      \n\n   2020-01-10            430                  55               53.56      \n--------------------------------------------------------------------------\n:::\n:::\n\n\nSuppose we wish to examine the hypothesis that there is a relationship between the number of patients checking into the hospital on any given day and the daily average waiting time. We could do that using correlation and report a correlation coefficient. Thus from our data of 362,305 patient records from the hospital's electronic medical records for the period of January 2020 to June 2022, we can calculate a Pearson's correlation coefficient of *r* = 0.84 (95% CI 0.82, 0.85), *p* \\< 0.01. This result suggests a strong positive linear relationship between the daily number of patients and the daily average waiting time.\n\n# Scatterplots\n\nWhat do we see when we plot the data i.e. a scatterplot of daily patient number against daily mean waiting time? @fig-scatterplot01 reveals something interesting. As expected from the correlation coefficient above, the regression line shows a strong positive relationship. However, what stands out is that the data is clustered into two groups suggesting group differences.\n\nIf we were to colour the data points by whether the day was a weekend (Saturday or Sunday) or a weekday (Monday to Friday), the nature of the clustering becomes clearer (@fig-scatterplot02). Also, the slopes of the regression lines are different for weekdays compared to weekends. Respectively the correlation coefficients are *r* = 0.67 (0.63, 0.71), *p* \\< 0.01 for weekdays, and *r* = 0.64 (0.57, 0.71), *p* \\< 0.01 for weekends.\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n::: {.cell-output-display}\n![Daily number of patients vs. daily mean waiting time](fig-scatterplot01-1.png){#fig-scatterplot01}\n:::\n:::\n\n::: {.cell}\n::: {.cell-output-display}\n![Clustering of observations by weekday](fig-scatterplot02-1.png){#fig-scatterplot02}\n:::\n:::\n\n\nThe confounding introduced by whether the day is a regular weekday or a weekend was revealed when we plotted the data. This is confirmed by the decrease in the correlation coefficients when we accounted for weekday. Therefore any subsequent analyses must account for the influence of weekday (see @tbl-regression02).\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n:::\n\n\nWe can reasonably expect that having more doctors on duty might reduce the average waiting time. We can therefore test the hypothesis that there is an inverse relationship between the daily number of available doctors and the daily average waiting time. There is a statistically significant relationship between the number of doctors on duty and the daily average waiting time: *r* = 0.80 (95% CI 0.77, 0.82), *p* \\< 0.01. We can also make a scatterplot of this relationship (@fig-scatterplot03).\n\n\n::: {#fig-scatterplot03 .cell layout-ncol=\"2\"}\n::: {.cell-output-display}\n![Overall regression line](fig-scatterplot03-1.png){#fig-scatterplot03-1}\n:::\n\n::: {.cell-output-display}\n![By weekday groups](fig-scatterplot03-2.png){#fig-scatterplot03-2}\n:::\n\nNumber of doctors and waiting time\n:::\n\n\nWe see here that the clustering by weekday type is even more accentuated. We also see that the relationship between number of doctors and waiting times is in the opposite direction to what we expected. Why is this? It is likely as more patients check into the hospital, more doctors are placed on the roster. In other words, the increase in the number of doctors is a response to increased patient numbers. The correlation coefficients are *r* = 0.56 (0.5, 0.61), *p* \\< 0.01 for weekdays, and *r* = 0.53 (0.43, 0.61), *p* \\< 0.01 for weekends. Again highlighting the confounding imposed by weekend or weekday. It is possible that there is an interaction effect between the number of doctors on duty and weekday type: there will be relatively less doctors on duty given the same number of patients on weekends compared to weekdays.\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n:::\n\n\nThis leads us to consider the relationship between daily patient numbers and daily number of doctors on the roster (@fig-scatterplot04). The difference between weekdays and weekends is even more pronounced. The point and interval estimates for the overall correlation coefficient is *r* = 0.92 (0.91, 0.93) while they are *r* = 0.82 (0.8, 0.85) for weekdays, and *r* = 0.67 (0.59, 0.73) for weekends respectively.\n\n\n::: {#fig-scatterplot04 .cell layout-ncol=\"2\"}\n::: {.cell-output-display}\n![Overall regression line](fig-scatterplot04-1.png){#fig-scatterplot04-1}\n:::\n\n::: {.cell-output-display}\n![By weekday groups](fig-scatterplot04-2.png){#fig-scatterplot04-2}\n:::\n\nDaily number of patients vs. daily number of doctors\n:::\n\n\n# Regression models\n\nWe now arrive at the point where we can attempt to develop an explanatory model for daily average waiting time (@eq-lrm01):\n\n\n$$\n\\begin{aligned}\ny = \\beta_0 &+ \\beta_{1} \\times \\text{daily patient number} + \\beta_{2} \\times \\text{daily doctor number}\\\\ &+ \\beta_{3} \\times \\text{weekend} + \\epsilon\n\\end{aligned}\n$$ {#eq-lrm01}\n\n\nWhere: \n\n- $y$ = daily average waiting time\n- $\\beta_0$ = constant term\n- $\\beta_1$, $\\beta_2$, $\\beta_3$ = regression coefficients, and\n- $\\epsilon$ = residual error term\n\n\\clearpage\n\n::: {#tbl-regression01 .cell .tbl-cap-location-bottom tbl-cap='Linear regression model of predictors of mean patient waiting time'}\n::: {.cell-output-display}\n| &nbsp;             |  **B** |    SE |   _t_ |    _p_ |\n|:-------------------|-------:|------:|------:|-------:|\n| (intercept)        |  26.27 | 2.426 | 10.83 | <0.001 |\n| number of patients |  0.109 | 0.007 | 15.42 | <0.001 |\n| number of doctors  | -0.011 | 0.076 | -0.15 |  0.881 |\n| weekends           | -8.425 | 1.997 | -4.22 | <0.001 |\n| _N_                |    912 |       |       |        |\n| $R^2$              |   0.71 |       |       |        |\n| adjusted $R^2$     |  0.709 |       |       |        |\n| AIC                |   7200 |       |       |        |\n:::\n:::\n\n\n\nThe results of the linear regression model are shown in @tbl-regression01. On average patients will wait about 8 minutes less on weekends. The model shows that there is not a statistically significant relationship between the number of doctors and daily average waiting time after adjusting for the effects of number of patients and weekend. So the earlier relationship we found for the relationship between the number of doctors and daily average waiting time is spurious. \n\nThe adjusted $R^2 = 0.709$ suggests that this model explains about 71% of the variation in the data. Does the performance of the model improve if we include the interaction between weekend and number of doctors (@eq-lrm02)? The results in @tbl-regression02 suggest there is only a marginal improvement (adjusted $R^2 = 0.717$), however the ANOVA test comparing the two models (not shown) indicates this second model is better. We can plot the **standardized** coefficients as a forest plot (@fig-forest) to show which variable has the most influence on daily average time.\n\n\n\n$$\n\\begin{aligned}\ny = \\beta_0 &+ \\beta_{1} \\times \\text{daily patient number} + \\beta_{2} \\times \\text{daily doctor number}\\\\ &+ \\beta_{3} \\times \\text{weekend} + \\beta_{4} \\times \\text{daily doctor number}\\cdot\\text{weekend} +\\epsilon\n\\end{aligned}\n$${#eq-lrm02}\n\n\n::: {#tbl-regression02 .cell .tbl-cap-location-bottom tbl-cap='Linear regression model of predictors of mean patient waiting time with interaction term'}\n::: {.cell-output-display}\n| &nbsp;                             |  **B** |    SE |   _t_ |    _p_ |\n|:-----------------------------------|-------:|------:|------:|-------:|\n| (intercept)                        |  28.34 | 2.426 | 11.68 | <0.001 |\n| number of patients                 |  0.106 | 0.007 |    15 | <0.001 |\n| number of doctors                  | -0.017 | 0.074 | -0.23 |  0.816 |\n| weekends                           | -30.29 |  4.68 | -6.47 | <0.001 |\n| number of doctors &middot; weekend |  1.363 | 0.265 |  5.15 | <0.001 |\n| _N_                                |    912 |       |       |        |\n| $R^2$                              |  0.719 |       |       |        |\n| adjusted $R^2$                     |  0.717 |       |       |        |\n| AIC                                |   7176 |       |       |        |\n:::\n:::\n\n\nThe weekday is the most influential variable on average waiting time, having the largest standardized coefficient $\\beta = 1.19$ while there is also a statistically significant interaction effect between the number of doctors and whether it is a weekend or not.\n\n\\clearpage\n\n::: {.cell}\n::: {.cell-output-display}\n![Forest plot of standardized regression coefficients](fig-forest-1.png){#fig-forest fig-pos='!h'}\n:::\n:::\n\n\n::: callout-note\nBut then this confirms what we can already infer from observation and commonsense.
