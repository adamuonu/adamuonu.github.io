I am an experienced physician / biostatistician with strong leadership skills, proven track record and a demonstrated history of working in the public and private healthcare and in public health in administrative, clinical roles and consulting roles with excellent outcomes. I am skilled in developing applications in R, SPSS, Stata, and Python. I possess practical experience in healthcare information technology (HIT).

Currently I am exploring how to improve cost-effectiveness and efficency in health care delivery through the use of machine learning algorithms applied to health data.
